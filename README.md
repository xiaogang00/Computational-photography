# Computational-photography
This is the course when I taken in the third year of my college life.

* Lab3: this project is aimed at how to complete a design of my own sparse matrix. The method I use here is **Compressed Row Storage**. After I complete the disign, I use the **Gauss-Seidel Method** to solve the problem of large scale of Sparse linear equations.
* Lab4: this project is aimed at achieve the simple method of gray map color. And in this experiment, we have used the sofrware of "colorization" to cimplete Interactive paint brush.
* Lab5: thsi project is aimed at design the algorithms of Gauss NewtonÂ to sovle the problem of the least squares problem.
* Lab6: this project is aimed at the panoramic stitching of two images or more images. I first transform the image coordinates of plane into cylindrical coordinates. And then I compute the feature and complete the feature matching. At last I used the relationship of matching to complete the panorama. Transfrom the cylindrical coordinates back into the plane coordinates.
* Lab7: this project is aimed at implement the method proposed by "Image Completion with Structure
  Propagation", by J. Sun, L. Yuan, J. Jia.
