This is the course when I taken in the third year of my college life.

* Lab3: this project is aimed at how to complete a design of my own sparse matrix. The method I use here is **Compressed Row Storage**. After I complete the disign, I use the **Gauss-Seidel Method** to solve the problem of large scale of Sparse linear equations.
* Lab4: this project is aimed at achieve the simple method of gray map color. And in this experiment, we have used the sofrware of "colorization" to cimplete Interactive paint brush.
* Lab5: thsi project is aimed at design the algorithms of Gauss Newton to sovle the problem of the least squares problem.
* Lab6: this project is aimed at the panoramic stitching of two images or more images. I first transform the image coordinates of plane into cylindrical coordinates. And then I compute the feature and complete the feature matching. At last I used the relationship of matching to complete the panorama. Transfrom the cylindrical coordinates back into the plane coordinates.
* Lab7: this project is aimed at implement the method proposed by "Image Completion with Structure
  Propagation", by J. Sun, L. Yuan, J. Jia. 
* Design Lab is a project which require us to design a innovative work to solve some problem. I did design a metric of attack verification code using the method of image processing such as chain code and other useful representation. The work is completed by first character segmentation，then image preprocessing and then design a deep learning metric to recognize the verification code.
