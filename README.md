This is the course when I taken in the third year of my college life.

* Lab3: this project is aimed at how to complete a design of my own sparse matrix. The method I use here is **Compressed Row Storage**. After I complete the disign, I use the **Gauss-Seidel Method** to solve the problem of large scale of Sparse linear equations.
*  Lab4: this project is aimed at achieve the simple method of gray map color. And in this experiment, we have used the sofrware of "colorization" to cimplete Interactive paint brush.
* Lab5: thsi project is aimed at design the algorithms of Gauss NewtonÂ to sovle the problem of the least squares problem.
